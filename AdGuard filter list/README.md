# Generate AdGuard filter list with powershell
In this example, I create a filter list to block Huawei domains with ad blocking app [AdGuard](https://adguard.com/).
The filter list should also work with ad blocking browser extension [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/).

The `.hosts` files are sourced from here: [https://codeberg.org/Cyanic76/Hosts](https://codeberg.org/Cyanic76/Hosts)

## Input
* URL(s) with `.hosts` files containing the domains to block

## Output
* URL of the plain text document containing the domains extracted from the `.hosts` files ðŸ‘‰ take this URL and add it to AdGuard

## Add the generated filter list to AdGuard
* Settings âž¡ Content blocking âž¡ Filters âž¡ Custom filters âž¡ âž• NEW CUSTOM FILTER âž¡ Add the URL âž¡ IMPORT

## Example output
Filter list: [http://sprunge.us/bZNyaw](http://sprunge.us/bZNyaw)
